### SAS
**Collection of SAS and SQL codes that I've developed over the years.**<br>

I use these codes so I don't ever have to reinvent the wheel (some of them are convoluted).

I also use it for quick reference, since it's too much information to memorize.

This is a work in progress, please bear with me. I have to clean up and convert more code files.

**Here are some examples of final products created in SAS:**

A dashboard created with SAS/GRAPH (nowadays this could've been done more easily in Power BI):

A SAS stored process created to automate data pulls:
