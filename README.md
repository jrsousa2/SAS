# SAS
**Collection of SAS and SQL codes that I developed over the years.**<br>

Some of the folders contain snashots of the final result (such as a SAS GRAPH dashboard and a stored process).
<br><i>Any info that could id anybody was carefully concealed from both code and image.</i>

I use these codes so I don't ever have to reinvent the wheel (some of them are convoluted).

I also use it for quick reference, since it's too much information to memorize.

This is a work in progress, please bear with me. I have to clean up and convert more code files.
