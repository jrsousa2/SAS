# SAS
**Collection of SAS and SQL codes that I developed over the years.**<br>

Some of the folders contain snashots of the final result (such as SAS GRAPH dashboard and the stored process).
<i>Any info that could id anybody was carefully concealed from both code and image.</i>

I use them so I don't ever have to reinvent the wheel (some of these codes are convoluted).

I also use it for quick reference, since it's too much information to memorize.

This is a work in progress, pls bear with me. I have to clean up and convert more code files.
