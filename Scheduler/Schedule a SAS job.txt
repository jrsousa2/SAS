✅ 1. Using SAS Management Console (SMC)
You can schedule SAS jobs using SMC, particularly if you're using SAS Metadata Server and Platform Process Manager (part of SAS Integration Technologies or Grid Manager).

In SMC:

Use Schedule Manager to create flow diagrams of job dependencies.

Define scheduling events like time triggers or file triggers.

Jobs are stored in SAS Metadata, making them manageable and reusable.

✔ Good for:

Centralized environments
GUI-based management
Metadata-integrated job tracking


✅ 2. Using cron (Unix Cron Scheduler)
You can schedule SAS jobs directly via Unix cron, bypassing SMC entirely.

Example cron entry:

0 3 * * * /opt/sas/sas9.4/sas -sysin /home/user/myjob.sas -log /home/user/logs/myjob.log

✔ Good for:

Lightweight, non-GUI setups
Environments without Metadata Server
Simple batch jobs


✅ 3. Using Shell Scripts
Shell scripts (.sh) often wrap SAS commands and are then scheduled via cron or other enterprise schedulers (e.g., Control-M, AutoSys).

#!/bin/bash
sas -sysin /home/user/myjob.sas -log /home/user/logs/myjob.log


✅ 4. Using Third-Party Enterprise Schedulers
Many companies integrate SAS jobs into:

Control-M
AutoSys
IBM TWS
Apache Airflow (in modern pipelines)

They call the SAS scripts or trigger metadata-based jobs using command-line tools like sastrigger or APIs.
