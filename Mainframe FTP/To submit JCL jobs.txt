1. ISPF (Interactive System Productivity Facility)
The most common TSO (Time Sharing Option) interface for IBM mainframes.

Users often go to ISPF option 3.4 to browse datasets and option 6 for command entry.

To submit JCL:
SUB 'USERID.JCL(MYJOB)'
Or while editing the JCL, just type SUBMIT on the command line.

2. TSO/3270 Emulator Clients
Used to access ISPF remotely from a PC:

IBM Personal Communications
Attachmate Extra!
Rocket BlueZone
TN3270 Plus
Rumba

These emulate a 3270 terminal, letting users connect to the mainframe and run TSO commands.
